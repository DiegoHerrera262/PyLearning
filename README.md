# Learning Basic Programming

This repo is intended to document all my learning process into the depths of programming.
Up to now, I've had basic trainning in C++, using standard 2017 to solve some computational
physics problems. Now, I want to progress to the next level by learning some python in the
context of more advanced computational physics problems, and gain more insight in programming
concepts.

## Objectives

My main objectives are:

* Learning how to code properly from my Android smarphone.
* Learning how to use advanced mathematical tools available on python 3 distributions.
* Learning how to use git in order to document this whole process.
* Learning how to take advantage of emacs' capabilities. 

## Resources

Concerning the learning resources, I'm using Termux app on my Android smartphone.
I've installed python 3, (last version up to the creation date) and clang. I'm
using, at least in principle, this packages:

* NumPy.
* SciPy.
* Matplotlib.
* Pandas.

I'm following two books on scientific computing. The first one is **Computational Physics**
by R. H. Landau, M. J. PÃ¡ez and C. C. Bordeianu. This book I intend to use as main reference
for learning computational physics and python skills. The second book is **Numerical python**
by R. Johansson. This book is my support reference on python. For learning emacs and git, I
rely on internet blogs, official manuals, and the git community itself.

**I wish myself a lot of luck !!**
